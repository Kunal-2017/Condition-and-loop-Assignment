Que 3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Sol:
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over arrays, and performing operations on collections of data.

There are several types of loops in JavaScript:

for loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    // code block to be executed
}
Example:

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

while loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
Syntax:


while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
}
Example:

var i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

do-while loop: Similar to a while loop, but the code block is executed at least once before the condition is checked.
Syntax:

do {
    // code block to be executed
} while (condition);

Example:

var i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
